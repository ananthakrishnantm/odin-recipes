    <p>This carne asada marinade is our family's favorite — and I've tried many! A 24-hour soak in a spicy citrus and soy marinade ensures your flank steak will be perfectly tender when it comes off the grill.</p>
    <p>A juicy and flavorful carne asada starts with a delicious carne asada marinade. This recipe begins with a 24-hour marinade to allow the flank steak to soak up all the tasty and fresh flavors before grilling.</p>

    <h3>Carne Asada:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds flank steak</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked.</li>
        <li>Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li>
        <li>After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from grill and slice across the grain.
        </li>
        <li>Place on a serving platter and pour the reserved, unused marinade over top. Serve immediately.</li>

    </ol>
