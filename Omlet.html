    <image src="./Images/omlet.jpg" alt="omlet in a plate"></image>
    <p> Never fear! Making an omelette at home is not difficult. With a few basic steps and a flip of the wrist, 
        you can pull off this recipe in minutes. Fill it with whatever you have on handâ€”it's a great way to use 
        up leftovers.</p>
        <p><strong>French omelette </strong> starts out with beaten eggs in the pan (just like scrambled eggs). The pan is shaken constantly 
            during cooking until the eggs just begin to set. When the eggs are cooked, the omelette is rolled and snugly folded 
            to form an oval and finally turned out onto a plate with the seam side down.</p>
